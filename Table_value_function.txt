#QUESTION : /*Using a table user-defined function retrieve voters who are born in 1990 from the voters table*/

One of the types of user-defined functions is a Table Value Function. A table-valued function returns a tabular data.
This is somewhat an opposite to a scalar function which returns single value.

Before SQL 2000, User Defined Functions (UDFs), were not available. Stored Procedures were often used in their place.

One of the advantages of User Defined Functions over Stored Procedures, 
is the fact that a UDF can be used in a #Select, #Where, or #Case #statement. 
They also can be used to create joins. In addition, User Defined Functions are simpler to invoke than Stored Procedures from inside another SQL statement.

Disadvantage of User-defined function
1. It can't be used to modify base table. DML statements such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE cannot be used on the base tables.
2. SQL functions that return non-deterministic values are not allowed  to be called from inside UDF. e.g GETDATE() is an example of non-deterministic function.

The RETURNS TABLE specifies that the function will return a table. This is strictly for learning purposes and might not be the best with regards to performance.

CREATE FUNCTION votersDOB (
	@YEAR INT)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
  SELECT * FROM 
  voters
  WHERE YEAR(birthdate) = @YEAR
  GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.votersDOB(1990);


Also note that the data is a fictitious data.
