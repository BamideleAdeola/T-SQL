#QUESTION : /*Create a simple function that adds 1000 to a given input in SQL server*/

SQL Server Functions are useful objects in SQL Server databases. 
A SQL Server function is a code snippet that can be executed on a SQL Server. 
It could be a user-defined function (created by the user) or a system defined function ( i.e built-in database functions). 

SQL Server user-defined functions are routines that accept parameters, perform an action, 
such as a complex calculation, and return the result of that action as a value. 
The return value can either be a single scalar value or a result set.

Benefits
1. Reusability in SQL Queries
2. Faster Execution
3. Reduce Netork traffic

In answering the above question, I created a function called dbo.add1000 which accepts integer as an input and returned that integer plus 1000.

CREATE FUNCTION dbo.Add1000 (@var INT)
RETURNS INT AS
BEGIN
	RETURN @var + 1000
END
GO


-- Select the function with 200 as parameter, this should return 1200
SELECT dbo.Add1000(200)
GO
