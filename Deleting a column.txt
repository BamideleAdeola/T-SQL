#QUESTION : /* Delete the field company from the ratings_dump table */

If you are a fan of #SQL, you should be familiar with languages such as DDL and DML.
DDL is Data Definition Language which is used to define data structures. For example: create table, alter table, rename, etc
DML is Data Manipulation Language which is used to manipulate data itself. For example: insert, update, delete, merge, etc

To answer the above question, we will use the ALTER STATEMENT which is a DDL. Then we will give the name of the table, 
and the keywords DROP COLUMN and finally give the name of the column which we would want to remove.


Query 1		-- #SQL #SERVER
ALTER TABLE ratings_dump
DROP COLUMN company;

SELECT * FROM ratings_dump;
    User_tables;
