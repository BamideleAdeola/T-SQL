#QUESTION : 
/*
Write a query that returns the total points contribution of a teams 
#Power #Forwards (PF) where their total points contribution is greater than 2000.
*/

I decided to look into basketball datasets with a keen interest of explaining the concept of #WHERE and #HAVING #Clause.
There are five (5) positions in #basketball. 
Shooting guard (SG), point guard (PG), power forward (PF), small forward (SF), and center (C). Each position has a distinct purpose on the court.
This post is not about explaining individual of these positions but to however, reiterate the importance of #data #specialist making some research. 

I am not totally a fan of #basketball but I had to make some research on these positions and it was interesting. 
The challenge is fully packed with some key concepts.
While the WHERE and HAVING clause can return similar output in some cases, you must beware of performance by understanding their specific use case.

The WHERE clause is used as a filter condition on individual rows, in this case, 
Position = 'PF', and HAVING is used as a numeric filter condition on 
grouped rows and must be used with an aggregate function, in this case, 
SUM(TotalPoints) > 2000.

SELECT Team, 
	SUM(TotalPoints) AS TotalPFPoints
FROM NbaPlayerStats
WHERE Position = 'PF'
GROUP BY Team
HAVING sum(TotalPoints) > 2000
ORDER BY TotalPFPoints DESC;

From the above results, although there are several teams with Totalpoints greater than 2000. 
However, Cleveland Cavaliers must've had some good Power Forwards that season.
