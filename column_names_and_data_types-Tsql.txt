#QUESTION : 
/*
Write a query to retrieve column names and data types of the voters table.
*/
Have you ever wondered what are the data types of your #Table columns?
In #SQL, the columns information schema view, which returns information about columns, is an ISO standard view that is supported by most of the major RDBMSs. 
You can use this view to get information about a columnâ€™s data type.
Most of the major RDBMs also provide other methods for getting column information.
The queries below are not exhaustible as there are various ways of achieving same output from different RDMS.
I am using #SQL #Server for this task.

QUERY 1
SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'voters';

QUERY 2
exec sp_help voters;

QUERY 3
SELECT TABLE_NAME,COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE, CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH, IS_NULLABLE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'voters'
