#QUESTION : /*Create an index view to retrieve total sales and total transactions from ProdTransaction and products_t table*/

If your scripts use the same set of SQL statements repeatedly then this can be converted into a function in the database.
There is a similarity between functions in SQL Server and other programming languages functions.
A user-defined function is a Transact-SQL or common language runtime (CLR) routine that accepts parameters, performs an action, 
such as a complex calculation, and returns the result of that action as a value. 
The returned value can either be a scalar (single) value or a table.
