#QUESTION : #Retrieve Weekday orders and Weekend Orders From Adventure2019 Database using CHOOSE() FUNCTION.

As a follow-up way of addressing or displaying weekday or weekend orders, the CHOOSE() Function combined with DATENAME and DATEPART can be used to address this challenge.

Still using #AdventureWorks2019 database to solve this challenge, I did a simple test to confirm if Today, November 5th, 2022 in Nigeria is a Weekend or Weekday. 

Your guess is as right as mine. Definitely a weekend


--Query 1: Weekend Orders

-- Confirming if today is a weekend or weekday
SELECT GETDATE() AS Today,
DATENAME(dw, GETDATE()) AS dayofweek,
CHOOSE(DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()), 'WEEKEND', 'Weekday',  -- starting a weekend from SUNDAY
 'Weekday', 'Weekday', 'Weekday', 'Weekday', 'WEEKEND') AS Workday;


--Query 2: Weekday/Weekend Orders

SELECT 
  s.ModifiedDate AS OrderDate,
  s.Orderqty AS Orders,
  DATENAME(dw, s.ModifiedDate) AS DayofWeek,
  CHOOSE(DATEPART(dw, s.ModifiedDate), 'WEEKEND','Weekday',
  'Weekday','Weekday','Weekday','Weekday','WEEKEND') AS WorkDay
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS s;
