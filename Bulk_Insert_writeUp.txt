#QUESTION : 
/* #Bulk #Insert eurovis.csv located in downloads into a table dbo.eurovis. Remove previous data and load the new dataset*/

Earlier in my career, one of the things I find difficult was bulk loading dataset into #SQL #Server. So I resulted to using management studio to import tables.

When I finally got how it works, I was so delighted and I documented it in my #GitHub account. 
This challenge helps with two tasks: to truncate and to bulk load. 
Truncating helps to clear a table leaving its structure intact. And the bulk insert helps to load the datasets from wherever it is stored into the truncated table. 

One thing to note is that you need to use the file path. Most often I use SHIFT + RIGHT CLICK to get the path of my data.
It is obvious that the data resides in my Downloads then we can specify some #WITH parameter. 
Format is a CSV and Firstrow begins at row 2 because first row is the header.

QUERY
-- truncate the table first
TRUNCATE TABLE dbo.eurovis;
GO
 
-- import the file
BULK INSERT dbo.eurovis
FROM 'C:\Users\User\Downloads\eurovis.csv'
WITH
(
        FORMAT='CSV',
        FIRSTROW=2
)
GO
