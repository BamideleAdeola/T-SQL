#QUESTION :/* Write an SQL query to create a ratings_dump #table with data & structure copied from ratings table.*/

Have you ever wondered how to clone a table or make a copy of a table to test your queries or something similar?
Creating a copy of a table is very simple in #SQL but you must know how it works in your #RDBMS. 

In SQL Server, it would amazed that with just a SELECT INTO clause, you can achieve this.

Query 1
SELECT * INTO ratings_dump
FROM ratings;

You do not need to create a separate table from the above code. While in #PostGreSQL, the below code works

Query 2
CREATE TABLE newfortune500 AS
SELECT *
FROM fortune500;

Copying query 2 on #SQL Server returns error. Hence, be familiar with your RDBMS #Syntax. 
I know there are several ways to clone a table. What is the best way you accomplish this?
