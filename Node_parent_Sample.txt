#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given a table mytree, which is a Binary Search Tree 
consisting of two columns Node (N) and Parent (P). Write a query 
that returns the node type ordered by the value of nodes in ascending order. 

There are 3 types.
Root — if the node is a root
Leaf — if the node is a leaf
Inner — if the node is neither root nor leaf.

A quick glance shows that if a given node N has its corresponding P-value as NULL it is the root. 
And for a given Node N if it exists in the P column it is not an inner node. 
Hence, we commence the query with a CASE Statement to capture all the above condition.
Also, we can use the CONCAT with the node to combine with its corresponding label.

SELECT CASE
    WHEN P IS NULL THEN CONCAT(N, ' Root')
    WHEN N IN (SELECT DISTINCT P FROM mytree) THEN CONCAT(N, ' Inner')
    ELSE CONCAT(N, ' Leaf') 
    END AS Node_Type
FROM mytree
ORDER BY N ASC;
