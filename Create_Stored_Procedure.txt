#QUESTION : /*Create a stored procedure of one dynamic parameter from the voters table*/

As a follow up on previous post on Stored Procedure. Remember, stored procedures are a batch of SQL statements that can be executed in a couple of ways. 
Most major DBMs support stored procedures; however, not all do. You will need to verify with your particular DBMS help documentation for specifics. 
I am using #SQL #Server for this.

SP are also good for calculations/data manipulation/report data sources in the Database.

Here are some of the benefits of SP:
1. Reusability
2. Security
3. Reduces network traffic
4. Better Performance

Stored procedures can also take parameters. This post will use a single dynamic parameter.

Also, when you use SET NOCOUNT ON, the message that indicates the number of rows that are affected by the T-SQL statement 
is not returned as part of the results. When you use SET NOCOUNT OFF; the count is returned. Using SET NOCOUNT ON can 
improve performance because network traffic can be reduced.

Your select statement can go into the BEGIN and END block for a clean code.

-- Stored procedure with a single parameter without SET NOCOUNT Condition
CREATE PROCEDURE voters_vote(@min_vote AS INT)
AS
BEGIN		
  SELECT first_name, gender, country, total_votes
  FROM voters
  WHERE total_votes >= @min_vote					
  ORDER BY total_votes DESC
END;		

EXEC voters_vote 100


-- Stored procedure with a single parameter with NOCOUNT Condition
CREATE PROCEDURE least_vote(@min_vote AS INT)
AS
SET NOCOUNT ON  
BEGIN
  SELECT first_name, gender, country, total_votes
  FROM voters
  WHERE total_votes >= @min_vote
  ORDER BY total_votes DESC
END;

EXEC least_vote 100;
