							----------------------------------
							    --HANDLING INVALID DATES 
							----------------------------------
/*
There are safe and unsafe functons
Unsafe			Safe
-------			-------
CAST()			TRY_CAST()
CONVERT()		TRY_CONVERT()
PARSE()			TRY_PARSE()


If you have good data, then use the unsafe function, However, if there is a single null in the date column, it would throw an error.
So use safe function. Safe function handles invalid dates by converting it to null.
