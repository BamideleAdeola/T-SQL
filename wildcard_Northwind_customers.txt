#QUESTION : 
/* Write an SQL query to fetch the contactName that begins with any two characters, followed by a text “ab” and ends with any sequence of characters.
*/

Understanding the underscore symbol of a wildcard is necessary in achieving the above task. 
A single underscore (_) represents a letter, hence the need to combine 2 underscore in solving the challenge.
The % symbol matches no or multiple characters.
Depending on your table structure and challenge, you might want to format your columns either with an UPPER() or LOWER() function. 
However, that is not needed for this challenge. 

SELECT ContactName
FROM dbo.Customers
WHERE ContactName LIKE '__ab%';

How would you have solved this?
