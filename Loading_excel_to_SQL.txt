#QUESTION : /*Using a table user-defined function retrieve voters who are born in 1990 from the voters table*/

If you have an excel file and it is seeming difficult to import it into #Microsoft #SQL #database may be because of 32/64 bit issues, then you can 
SQL Server Import and Export Data app. I am using SQL Server 2019 and Import and Export Data engine came with the server installation. 

Previously, I would always want to convert to csv or find a way to create a table and columns within SQL before importing the data. 

This approach worked for me after some research and I taught to share. 







Please should you have a better approach feel free to put it in the comment box


Also note that the data is a fictitious data.
