#QUESTION : /*Demonstrate what happens when the source table of a view is dropped*/

Again, View is simply subset of table which are stored logically in a database. 
Hence, a view is a virtual table in the database whose contents are defined by a query. 
However, while there are several benefits for creating a view in #SQL, here are some of the major set backs.

- Performance: Views create the appearance of a table, but the DBMS must still translate queries against the view into queries against the underlying source tables. 
If the view is defined by a complex, multi-table query then simple queries on the views may take considerable time.

- Update restrictions
When a user tries to update rows of a view, the DBMS must translate the request into an update on rows of the underlying source tables. 
This is possible for simple views, but more complex views are often restricted to read-only.

- When a table is dropped, automatically, views will be affected since it is linked to a table.

- Parameters cannot be passed

- Order by is a NO-NO in creation of views without specifying FOR XML, OFFSET, or TOP

- The Views cannot be created based on Temporary Tables in SQL Server

Are you aware of other disadvantage of creating a view? Drop a comment please.

CREATE VIEW vtest AS		
SELECT * FROM ratings_dump
WHERE company_location = 'France';

SELECT * FROM vtest;	  -- There is output here because the underlining table is active

DROP TABLE ratings_dump;  -- Drop the attached ratings_dump table

SELECT * FROM vtest;	  -- Invalid Object name 'ratings_dump'
