#QUESTION : 
 /*
Write SQL Query to get the actual price of product (ListPrice + 20% GST) with Product_name and ProductNumber for all products who have product name not starting with A AND product_id must be greater than or equal to 316
And Listprice is not 0. Sort your result with Product_name
*/

Here is another interview question which I have tried to attempt solving using AdventureWordks2012 Database. 
No doubt that understanding percentage increase or decrease can help in solving this question. 
By normal standard one would want to first divide 20/100 = 0.2, then multiply by listprice to get the equivalent 20% of price. 
However, we still need to add this value back to price to get the new price. In all these divisions, the data is not neatly formated, 
hence the need for CAST, Convert, etc function. 

My second approach right from the elementary mathematics class would be to just add 20% + 100% since we are increasing price value and multiple it to price. 
i.e 120% ^ price. which is 1.2 * listPrice, then wrap in a CAST() Function. 

Which of the two approach would you have rather go for?

-- Query 1
SELECT  
	ProductID, 
	Name As ProductName,
	ListPrice,
	CAST(((0.20 * listPrice) + listPrice) AS DECIMAL(6,2))  AS Actual_price
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Name not Like 'A%'
 AND ProductID >= '316'
 AND listPrice != 0
ORDER BY ProductID ASC;

-- Query 2 (multiply price by 1.20) which is 120%
SELECT  
	ProductID, 
	Name As ProductName,
	ListPrice,
	CAST((1.2 * listPrice) AS DECIMAL(6,2)) AS Actual_price
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Name not Like 'A%'
 AND ProductID >= '316'
 AND listPrice > 0
ORDER BY ProductID ASC;
