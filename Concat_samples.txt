#QUESTION : /*Query all firstnames immediately followed by the first letter in 
the last_name column enclosed in parenthesis.*/

As a data specialist, you would have to deal with string function at some point in your data journey. 
Since the above challenge asked to combine the first_name and lastname, we can use CONCAT() function. 
We also need to have only one letter inside the parenthesis. Hence we can use the LEFT() and CONCAT based on the requirement.
Or SUBSTRING and pass the column name, start index, end index. 
Since the first letter is required, we will pass 1,1(start index is inclusive and the end index is not inclusive). 

--QUERY 1	-- using CONCAT and LEFT
SELECT
 CONCAT(first_name,' (', LEFT(last_name,1), ')')
FROM voters;

--QUERY 2 	-- using CONCAT and SUBSTRING
SELECT
 CONCAT(first_name,' (', SUBSTRING(last_name, 1,1), ')')
FROM voters;

How would you have solved this?
