#QUESTION : /*Modify an existing function dbo.votesfn to remove 10% from total votes field in the voters table*/

Imagine that you have created a user-defined fucntion and you intend to modify it so as to meet the changing business requirements.

Instead of creating a new column with 10% increase, you intend to subtract 10% from the total votes. 

You can use one of the following functions:
a. ALTER: This helps to modify an existing function
b. CREATE OR ALTER: This checks if the function exists, then it alter it. However, if it doesn't, then it creates it.

I love to use the CREATE OR ALTER function because of its flexibility. 

Hence, using our previous percentage increase experience, instead of adding the percentage, we will subtract it.

CREATE OR ALTER FUNCTION dbo.votesfn (@votes INT, @Percent INT)
RETURNS INT AS
BEGIN
	RETURN @votes - (@votes * @Percent)/100
END
GO


SELECT * , 
  dbo.votesfn(total_votes, 10) AS Ten_Percent_Minus,
  dbo.votesfn(total_votes, 5) AS Five_Percent_Minus
FROM voters
GO

Also note that the data is a fictitious data.
