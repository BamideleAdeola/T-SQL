#QUESTION : /* List all Stored Procedures present in a database called TestDb and their object definitions*/

Definitely some stored procedures might have been created in our database. How do you view them? 
Using SSMS, do the following: 
1. Expand programmability
2. Expand Stored Procedure
Then you will see the list of your SP. However, what if you intend to see the content in your stored procedure? Then proceed to steps 3. 

3. Right click on the stored procedure and select Script Stored Procedure as | CREATE To | New Query Editor Window

Also, you can view your stored procedures using T-SQL codes in different ways. See some of the codes I use to view SP in my database.
 
What works best for me in retrieving names and definitions of the procedures is calling OBJECT_DEFINITION from sys.objects.

-- Retrieve only the name and stored procedure
SELECT 
 name AS Procedures, 
 object_definition(object_id) AS [Procedure Definition]
FROM sys.objects 
WHERE type='P';

Please go through the screenshots. I know it's a lot but this is my last write up on stored procedures at least for this year.
