#QUESTION : /*Create a synonym prod for [TestOrders].[dbo].[products_t], insert into the synonym and confirm the inserted values in products_t table*/

In SQL Server, the synonym is the database object that provides alternate name (alias) 
to another database objects such as table, view, stored procedure, etc. in the local server or a remote server. 
It provides a layer of abstraction and protects the client application in case of a name change or location change made to the base object.

Note the following:
- You need a CREATE SYNONYM permission and either own the schema or have ALTER SCHEMA permission.
- A synonym must have a unique name just like other database objects in a schema.
- A synonym cannot be a base object for another synonym.
- A synonym cannot reference a user -defined aggregate function.
- Inserting values into the synonym would automatically updates the source table.


USE TestOrders;
GO

CREATE SYNONYM Prod 
FOR [TestOrders].[dbo].[products_t]
GO

-- Insert values into the synonym [Prod] 
INSERT INTO Prod
VALUES ( 6, 'Blade', 32);

-- To confirm if the update reflects on product table
SELECT * FROM products_t;

As can be seen, the insert on synonym prod reflects on the product_t table. Again, synonym protects the client application in case of a name change or location change made to the base object.
Have you used synonyms before or would you love to try it out?
