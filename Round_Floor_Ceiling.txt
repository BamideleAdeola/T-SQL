#QUESTION : /*Demonstrate the difference amongst Round, Floor and Ceiling in #SQL*/

I got a question from a student and thought to share. He asked how to convert 248774 to 249000. 
From the above, it means rounding off the value to the nearest thousand in mathematical terms. 
The ROUND function in SQL is used to round a given number to the nearest integer or to a certain decimal place. 
Close to the round function are the duo: Ceiling and Floor functions. 

CEILING: It evaluates a value and return the smallest integer greater than, or equal to, the specified numeric expression. This excludes decimal points.
FLOOR: Returns the #LARGEST smallest integer greater than, or equal to, the specified numeric expression.

SELECT 
ROUND(248774, -3) AS round_no_5above,	--5-9 rounded up as 1  
ROUND(248374, -3) AS round_no_below_5;	--0-4 is rounded down as 0

SELECT 
CEILING(547.34)	AS Ceiling_Value,	-- Approximates upwards
FLOOR(547.34) AS Floor_value;		-- Removes decimal values and return the integer values
