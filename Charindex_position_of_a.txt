#QUESTION : 
/* Write an SQL query to fetch the position of a in first_name field of the voters table. 
   Retrieve only instance where a occurs in your output.*/


A good function to also be aware of in the string manipulation box is CHARINDEX. This searches for a substring in a string and returns a position. 
Note that if the substring is not found, then 0 is returned. Also, it is not case-sensitive. 
a and A is seen as same.

On the above challenge using SQL Server, We pass a to be searched in firstname and stored it as position_of_a. 

Note, without the start option, CHARINDEX starts searching from the first character from the left.

Adding a WHERE CLAUSE to sieve out all instances of 0 to retrieve the required outcome.

SELECT first_name, CHARINDEX('a' , first_name) AS position_of_a
FROM voters
WHERE CHARINDEX('a' , first_name) != 0;

How would you have solved this using your preferred RDMS?
