#QUESTION : 
  /* Are there any difference amongst #DELETE, #TRUNCATE, & #DROP?.*/

I get this question frequently, to differentiate amongst the trio - #DELETE, #TRUNCATE & #DROP. 
Let me use a simple meme to explain this. 

#DELETE: I am delete, I regard myself as more important than the rest because you can use me to remove specific rows or columns of interest with a #WHERE clause.
Also, without a WHERE Clause, I can delete all records in a table. Although, performance issue might set in here.
  DELETE FROM Orders
  WHERE OrderID = 5;

OR

DELETE FROM Orders;  -- Note that this has performance issue, just use Truncate instead.

#TRUNCATE: Really? What if you need to remove entire datasets without removing the structure (the columns and Table) and still have good performance? I, #TRUNCATE makes life easier at just a click.
  TRUNCATE TABLE Orders;

#DROP: Hmmm. Have you guys forgotten that most times, the entire table needs to be removed (table, data and columns inclusive)? This is where I, #DROP just drop it off.
  DROP TABLE Orders;

In all, None of these trio supersedes the other. It is all about your business case. And what you intend to achieve.  
I left some use case out, can you help provide anyone too?
Trust you find this useful.
