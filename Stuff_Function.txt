#QUESTION : 
 /* Write an #SQL #query to replace the first two characters in first_name field of voters table with the string 'Mr. '*/

While there are several ways to achieve the above challenge. I used the STUFF() function here.
The STUFF() function deletes a part of a string and then inserts another part into the string, starting at a specified position.
It is used to overwrite existing character or inserts a string into another string. 
Syntax:
STUFF(string_expression,start, length, replacement_characters)
While Stuff and Replace function are closely related, their difference are obvious. 

#STUFF function is used to insert a string into another string by deleting some characters specified.
On the other hand, #REPLACE instead of replacing specific characters, replaces existing characters of all occurrences.

QUERY
SELECT 
	first_name,
	STUFF(first_name, 1, 2,'Mr. ')
FROM voters;

What are other use cases you would love to use the Stuff Function?
How would you have solved this using your preferred RDMS seeing that this uses SQL Server?
Trust you find this useful.
