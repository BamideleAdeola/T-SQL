#QUESTION : 
/*
Write a query that retrieves annual sum of total votes side by side previous year and next year.
And their differences.
*/

In the business world, you would always want to compare current sales with previous sales to make an informed decision of your sales pipeline or performance. 
#SQL #Lead and #Lag function helps to achieve this comparison. 

The LEAD function is used to access data from SUBSEQUENT rows along with data from the current row.
The LAG function is used to access data from PREVIOUS rows along with data from the current row.
An ORDER BY clause is required both functions, however a PARTITION BY clause is optional.
From the above challenge, a subquery that sums the votes would be executed before the window function.

To ascertain the annual sum of total votes, it means we have to group the sum by year. That was achieved in the subquery.


SELECT 
 vote_year,
 sum_total_vote,
 LAG(sum_total_vote) OVER (ORDER BY sum_total_vote) AS lag,
 LEAD(sum_total_vote) OVER (ORDER BY sum_total_vote) AS lead,
 sum_total_vote - LAG(sum_total_vote) OVER (ORDER BY sum_total_vote) AS lag_difference,
 LEAD(sum_total_vote) OVER (ORDER BY sum_total_vote) - sum_total_vote AS lead_difference
FROM (
	SELECT YEAR(first_vote_date) AS vote_year,
	   SUM(total_votes) AS sum_total_vote
FROM voters 
GROUP BY YEAR(first_vote_date)) sub;
