#QUESTION : /*How do I see the sysnonyms and base_object name of sysnonyms created in a database - TestOrders? */

My last post for 2022 was creating #synonyms in #sql, its benefits and use case. Please read my last post to refresh on how to create a synonym and using synonyms to insert data into the main base object.

However, I got a follow-up question on how to use T-SQL to query the synonyms already created. 

Hence, the need for this short post. Definitely, you can use #SSMS to view synonyms within a database. 


USE TestOrders;
GO

SELECT 
 name, 
 base_object_name, 
 type
FROM 
 sys.synonyms
ORDER BY
 name;
