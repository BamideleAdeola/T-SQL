#QUESTION : 
 /* Retrieve the First day of month of the StartDate Column in CapitalBikeShare Table */

#As a data specialist and most especially a lover of #SQL, you will definitely have to deal with Date manipulation.
The DATEADD, DATEDIFF, DATEPART, DATENAME, etc would be of help here. 
I have loaded the CapitalBikeShare dataset into my SQL Server Management Studio and intend to return first day of the month of the StartDate column. 

When using a nested function as below, the query runs from the innermost function outwards.
So the DATEDIFF() before the DATEADD. 

Note that calculating the difference in months between StartDate and 0 would return difference between 1/1/1900 (the begin date for SQL) and StartDate in months.
Add 0 months to that difference to get the first day of the month.

QUERY 1
SELECT 
	StartDate, 
	DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 0, StartDate), 0) AS first_Day_of_the_month
FROM dbo.CapitalBikeShare;


This can also be used to retrieve the first day of the current month as seen below: 
QUERY 2
-- First day of the current month
SELECT DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 0, GETDATE()), 0) AS First_day_of_this_month;

How would you have solved this?
