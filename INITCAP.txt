#QUESTION : 
  /* Write an SQL query to fetch the lower, all capital and first letter capital 
  letter of first_name field of the voters table. */

Generally speaking, there are three case manipulation functions in SQL, Lower, Upper and Proper. This is from my experience in #Excel. 
Switching to #SQL, an interview question was specific about using #SQL #Server to return these 3 manipulations.
You would be amazed Proper which is first letter capital letter is not as straight forward as the remaining 2, atleast to me. 
In Excel, I can pass Proper and the text, which will return required output.
However, some RDBMS have direct functions like INITCAP that can solve this challenge. 

My approach below, uses 5 functions to retrieve the output. 
1. LEFT = Extract the first letter
2. UPPER = Capitalize the first letter
3. SUBSTRING = extracts part of a string with start and end parameter. Apparently, the start will be the second character.
4. LEN = provides the length of a string. This will be the end parameter for the substring
5. Concat (+) = The + symbol combines the functions.


SELECT first_name, 
	LOWER(first_name) AS lowercase,
	UPPER(first_name) AS uppercase,
	UPPER(LEFT(first_name,1)) + SUBSTRING(first_name, 2, LEN(first_name)) AS FirstletterCaps
FROM voters;

How would you have solved this using your preferred RDMS seeing that this uses SQL Server?
