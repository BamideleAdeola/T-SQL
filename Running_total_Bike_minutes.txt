#QUESTION :/* Retrieve a running total of minutes spent on capital bike trips per day.*/

I am excited about #ChatGPT and I felt to look into how to use it in solving some #SQL Queries. 
Like the above question on running total. All I did was ask how to code running total in #SQL #Server.
Gbam, It answers questions and also writes narrations/essays too. 
 
ChatGPT is a prototype artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI which specializes in dialogue. 
The chatbot is a large language model fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. 
It is based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, an improved version of GPT-3.

ChatGPT was launched in November 2022 and has garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers, 
although its factual accuracy has been criticized.

At least, query samples were returned with some explanations. 
Running total is a cumulative summation of a column and #Window function helps in achieving this.


SELECT
 start_station,
 Start_date,
 Duration,
 SUM(Duration) OVER (ORDER BY Start_date
   ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING 
      AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM CapitalTrips;
