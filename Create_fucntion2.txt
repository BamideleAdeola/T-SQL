#QUESTION : /*Create a function that computes dynamic percentage increase to total votes field in the voters table*/

As a follow up in the previous post about user-defined functions in #SQL, you can also create a function to return a column based on the condition set in the block areas of the function

Here, I have created a dynamic function that accepts two parameters: 
a. A column
b. A percent

Within the function block, I have also passed the required computation or calculation, This is seen in 

RETURN @votes + (@votes * @Percent)/100 where @votes represent the column total_votes of the voters table and @percent can be dynamically inserted.


CREATE FUNCTION dbo.votesfn (@votes INT, @Percent INT)
RETURNS INT AS
BEGIN
	RETURN @votes + (@votes * @Percent)/100
END
GO

-- To confirm if this works, I have also inputed 10 and 5 as input parameters
SELECT * , 
  dbo.votesfn(total_votes, 10) AS Ten_Percent_Add, 
  dbo.votesfn(total_votes, 5) AS Five_Percent_Add 
FROM voters
GO

Also note that the data is a fictitious data.
